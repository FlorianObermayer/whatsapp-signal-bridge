# Whatsapp Signal Bridge

This application lets you forward all messages which you receive in your Whatsapp account to signal. Big thanks to all contributors of the [Rhymen/go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp) and [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).

## How it works

For this application to work you need a separate phone number for your bot. The bot sends the Whatsapp messages to your main signal number. So you receive all Whatsapp messages in a separate signal chat.

The messages you receive in this signal chat include the Whatsapp chat-id, the name or the number of the sender, the group name, the message and the attachments.

_Example text message structure:_

```
chatid:000000-000000@g.us
chat:Chat with friends
sender:Mike
---
Hi there
```

You can reply to the messages by quoting them. The reply will be sent back through the bot in the corresponding Whatsapp chat including attachments.

## Requirements

You need to install [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).

([Native Library](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/Provide-native-lib-for-libsignal)) ([Use Correct Libsignal-client Version](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/issues/562#issuecomment-792274797)) ([Maybe useful](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/discussions/393#discussioncomment-246169))

## Build

```go
go build -o bot .
```

## First Run

On the first run you have to connect your Whatsapp account to the application. This is done by adding the application as Whatsapp-Web client.

On the first run you have to scan the qr-code which will be presented on your terminal.

```bash
./bot --bot=<bot-number> --receiver=<signal-receiver-number>
# now scan the presented qr-code
```

After the qr-code was scanned the connection should be established and the session is stored in a file. On the next run of this application, the session will be loaded directly. You don't have to scan the qr-code again.

## Start Bridge for Production

```bash
# this script starts the application in the background
./start.sh <bot-numer> <signal-receiver-number>
# stopping the background script
./stop.sh
```

> Remember that only one concurrent Whatsapp-Web connection can be active!

## Skills

You can control the application with a couple of commands. Type `@bot help` in signal or Whatsapp for more information.
